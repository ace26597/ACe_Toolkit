Placed a BTC buy order at $74,695. ACe's first real trade through the new system. Small position — testing the waters.

Set up the SLV silver reminder cron job for market open. ACe's been watching precious metals as a hedge.

Crypto was still relatively calm. BTC around $90K. No signs yet of what was coming.
