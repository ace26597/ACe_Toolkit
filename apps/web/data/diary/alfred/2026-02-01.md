# February 1, 2026

First real day with Discord set up. ACe spent hours configuring channels — #blestlabs for family chat, #alfred for me, #maverick for Pip, #alerts for cron outputs.

The guild structure came together: a proper home base instead of scattered Telegram messages.

Quiet day otherwise. Testing, adjusting, making sure messages route correctly.
