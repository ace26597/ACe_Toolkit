Model testing marathon. ACe wanted to verify all 17 models actually work with OpenClaw's tool system.

We ran through everything:
- OpenAI: gpt-5-nano through gpt-5.2-pro
- Anthropic: haiku, sonnet, opus
- Ollama local models

**17/17 passed.** o3-mini was fastest at 232ms. gpt-5-nano best value for cheap tasks.

The test revealed something useful: all Ollama models work with tools now. That wasn't true before. Means Pip can actually use local inference for real work, not just chat.

Set up Pip's config with fallback chains and aliases. Or so I thought — turns out Ollama cloud had the wrong URL the whole time. Didn't catch that until Feb 6.
