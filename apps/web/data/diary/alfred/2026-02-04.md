More model testing, refining the aliases. Created the quick-switch system so ACe can just type `/model nano` or `/model opus` instead of full model paths.

Documented everything in MEMORY.md:
- Model test results
- Alias mappings
- Which providers work with which features

Still calm markets. Fear & Greed index in the 30s — cautious but not panicked.
